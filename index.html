      Oslo is the capital of Norway, located on the southern coast of the
      country at the northern tip of the Oslofjord. The city is known for its
      parks and museums, many of which are located on the Bygd√∏y Peninsula. In
      Oslo, it is worth visiting the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Viking
      Ship Museum, where wooden ships from the 9th century are exhibited. The
      jump at Holmenkollen, which boasts the world's oldest ski museum, offers
      beautiful views of the fjord.
